## Description
Explain what the project does.

Creates a the UI for the sokoban game that will be utilized in the enxt project.


### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.

I used a Vector of a vector of characters (a 2d vector) to store the level data input from the file using the insertion operator. I did it using this method as it felt it would be better for practice, although a 1d array/vector would also work. I ued a switch statment instead of if-else-ifs for displaying the sprites becuase its faster. Everything else was decided by the conditions needed in the PDF.

### Memory
Describe how you decided to store the level data including whether you used smart pointers.

I used a Vector of a vector characters (a 2d vector) to store the level data as previously mentioned.

### Lambdas
Describe what <algorithm> functions you used and what lambda expressions you wrote.

I did not use lanbda functions or <algorithms>

### Issues
What did you have trouble with?  What did you learn?  What doesn't work?  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.

I didnt follow the pathway that was described at first, which led to me having to backtrack at some points making this take longer than neccisary.

I didnt do anything special.
